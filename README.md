# UnityUtilities
Collection of useful scripts for Unity.

Repository contains scripts created by me or, if stated at the beginning of a script, from others (some of them I might have modified).
Mind the licenses stated at the beginning of each script or method (those are not mine). Scripts/methods without license at the beginning are mine
and are distributed under MIT license.

Note that there might be bugs, use at your own risk.
